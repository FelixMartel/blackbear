# disable sandbox and use internal crypto, openssl 1.1 is not supported
./configure --with-sandbox=no --without-openssl

Be wary of sandbox and privilege separation

seccomp being used to sandbox unprivileged process
sandbox-seccomp-filter.c
in monitor.c
mm_get_xxxx = requests from unpriv to priv
mm_answer_xxx = responses from privileged process

reversing connection

need to explore code to see puzzle, reassemble pieces to create new 
puzzle

client

need to know how to fill struct addrinfo

- ssh_connect_direct
- ssh_connect
- resolve_host in ssh.c returns struct addrinfo

lay new logic near ssh_connect call in ssh.c  create ssh_listen function in sshconnect.c
